/**
 * <p>A Process Application is an ordinary Java Application that uses the camunda process engine for
 * BPM and Worklow functionality. Most such applications will start their own process engine (or use
 * a process engine provided by the runtime container), deploy some BPMN 2.0 process definitions and
 * interact with process instances derived from these process definitions. Since most process applications
 * perform very similar bootstrapping, deployment and runtime tasks, we generalized this functionality.
 * The concept is similar to the javax.ws.rs.core.Application class in JAX-RS: adding the process
 * application class allows you to bootstrap and configure the provided services.</p>
 *
 * <p>Adding a ProcessApplication class to your Java Application provides your applications with the
 * following services:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Bootstrapping</strong> embedded process engine(s) or looking up container managed process engine(s).
 * You can define multiple process engines in a file named processes.xml which is added to your application.
 * The ProcessApplication class makes sure this file is picked up and the defined process engines are started
 * and stopped as the application is deployed / undeployed.</li>
 * <li><strong>Automatic deployment</strong> of classpath BPMN 2.0 resources. You can define multiple deployments
 * (process archives) in the processes.xml file. The process application class makes sure the deployments
 * are performed upon deployment of your application. Scanning your application for process definition
 * resource files (engine in *.bpmn20.xml or *.bpmn) is supported as well.</li>
 * <li><strong>Classloading & Thread context switching:</strong> Resolution of application-local Java Delegate Implementations and Beans in case of a
 * multi-application deployment. The process application class allows your java application to
 * expose your local Java Delegate implementations or Spring / CDI beans to a shared, container managed
 * process engine. This way you can start a single process engine that dispatches to multiple process
 * applications that can be (re-)deployed independently.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Transforming an existing Java Application into a Process Application is easy and non-intrusive.
 * You simply have to add:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A Process Application class: The Process Application class constitutes the interface between
 * your application and the process engine. There are different base classes you can extent to reflect
 * different environments (e.g. Servlet vs. EJB Container):
 * <ul>
 *  <li> {@link ServletProcessApplication}: To be used for Process Applications is a Servlet Container like Apache Tomcat.</li>
 *  <li> {@link EjbProcessApplication}: To be used in a Java EE application server like WildFly, Glassfish or WebSphere Application Server.</li>
 *  <li> {@link EmbeddedProcessApplication}: To be used when embedding the process engine is an ordinary Java SE application.</li>
 *  <li> org.camunda.bpm.engine.spring.application.SpringProcessApplication: To be used for bootstrapping the process application from a Spring Application Context.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>A processes.xml file to META-INF: The deployment descriptor file allows to provide a declarative
 * configuration of the deployment(s) this process application makes to the process engine. It can be
 * empty and serve as simple marker file - but it must be present.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
