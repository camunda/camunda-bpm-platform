   *

   *     <pre>
   *     |-- My-Application.war
   *         |-- WEB-INF
   *             |-- lib/

   *                     |-- opps/openOpportunity.bpmn
   *                     |-- leads/openLead.bpmn
   *
   *                 |-- Invoice-Processes.jar
   *                     |-- META-INF/processes.xml  (2)
   *    </pre>
   *    If the process archive(s) defined in (1) uses a path prefixed with "pa:", like for instance "pa:opps/",
   *    only the "opps/"-folder of sales-processes.jar is scanned. More precisely, a "pa-local path", is resolved
   *    relative to the the parent directory of the META-INF-directory containing the defining processes.xml file.
   *    This implies, that using a pa-local path in (1), no processes from (2) are visible.
   *    <p />
   *   </li>
