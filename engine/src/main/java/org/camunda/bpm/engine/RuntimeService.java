  /**
   * <p>Allows retrieving the activity instance tree for a given process instance.
   * The activity instance tree is aligned with the concept of scope in the BPMN specification.
   * Activities that are "on the same level of subprocess" (ie. part of the same scope, contained
   * in the same subprocess) will have their activity instances at the same level in the tree.</p>
   *
   * <h2>Examples:</h2>
   * <p><ul>
   *  <li>Process with two parallel user tasks after parallel Gateway: in the activity instance tree you
   *  will see two activity instances below the root instance, one for each user task.</li>
   *  <li>Process with two parallel Multi Instance user tasks after parallel Gateway: in the activity instance
   *  tree, all instances of both user tasks will be listed below the root activity instance. Reason: all
   *  activity instances are at the same level of subprocess.</li>
   *  <li>Usertask inside embedded subprocess: the activity instance three will have 3 levels: the root instance
   *  representing the process instance itself, below it an activity instance representing the instance of the embedded
   *  subprocess, and below this one, the activity instance representing the usertask.</li>
   * </ul></p>
   *
   * <h2>Identity & Uniqueness:</h2>
   * <p>Each activity instance is assigned a unique Id. The id is persistent, if you invoke this method multiple times,
   * the same activity instance ids will be returned for the same activity instances. (However, there might be
   * different executions assigned, see below)</p>
   *
   * <h2>Relation to Executions</h2>
   * <p>The {@link Execution} concept in the process engine is not completely aligned with the activity
   * instance concept because the execution tree is in general not aligned with the activity / scope concept in
   * BPMN. In general, there is a n-1 relationship between Executions and ActivityInstances, ie. at a given
   * point in time, an activity instance can be linked to multiple executions. In addition, it is not guaranteed
   * that the same execution that started a given activity instance will also end it. The process engine performs
   * several internal optimizations concerning the compacting of the execution tree which might lead to executions
   * being reordered and pruned. This can lead to situations where a given execution starts an activity instance
   * but another execution ends it. Another special case is the process instance: if the process instance is executing
   * a non-scope activity (for example a user task) below the process definition scope, it will be referenced
   * by both the root activity instance and the user task activity instance.
   *
   * <p><strong>If you need to interpret the state of a process instance in terms of a BPMN process model, it is usually easier to
   * use the activity instance tree as opposed to the execution tree.</strong></p>
   *
   * @param processInstanceId the id of the process instance for which the activity instance tree should be constructed.
   *
   * @return the activity instance tree for a given process instance or null if no such process instance exists.

   * @throws ProcessEngineException
