/**
 * Log entry about an operation performed by a user. This is used for logging
 * actions such as creating a new task, completing a task,
 * canceling a process instance, ...
 *
 * <h2>Operation Type</h2>
 * <p>The type of the operation which has been performed. A user may create a new task,
 * complete a task, delegate a tasks, etc... Check this class for a list of built-in
 * operation type constants.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Entity Type</h2>
 * <p>The type of the entity on which the operation was performed. Operations may be
 * performed on tasks, attachments, ...</p>
 *
 * <h2>Affected Entity Criteria</h2>
 * <p>
 *   The methods that reference other entities (except users), such as {@link #getProcessInstanceId()}
 *   or {@link #getProcessDefinitionId()}, describe which entities were affected
 *   by the operation and represent restriction criteria.
 *   A <code>null</code> return value of any of those methods means that regarding
 *   this criterion, any entity was affected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   For example, if an operation suspends all process instances that belong to a certain
 *   process definition id, one operation log entry is created.
 *   Its return value for the method {@link #getProcessInstanceId()} is <code>null</code>,
 *   while {@link #getProcessDefinitionId()} returns an id. Thus, the return values
 *   of these methods can be understood as selection criteria of instances of the entity type
 *   that were affected by the operation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
 * <p>The event describes which user has requested out the operation and the time
 * at which the operation was performed. Furthermore, one operation can result in multiple
 * {@link UserOperationLogEntry} entities whicha are linked by the value of the
 * {@link #getOperationId()} method.</p>
