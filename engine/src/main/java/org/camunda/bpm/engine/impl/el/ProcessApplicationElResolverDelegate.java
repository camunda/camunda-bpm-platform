/**
 * <p>This is an {@link ELResolver} implementation that delegates to a ProcessApplication-provided
 * {@link ELResolver}. The idea is that in a multi-application setup, a shared process engine may orchestrate
 * multiple process applications. In this setting we want to delegate to the current process application
 * for performing expression resolving. This also allows individual process applications to integrate with
 * different kinds of Di Containers or other expression-context providing frameworks. For instance, a first
 * process application may use the spring application context for resolving Java Delegate implementations
 * while a second application may use CDI or even an Apache Camel Context.</p>
 *
 * <p>The behavior of this implementation is as follows: if we are not currently running in the context of
 * a process application, we are skipped. If we are, this implementation delegates to the underlying
 * application-provided {@link ELResolver} which may itself be a {@link CompositeELResolver}.</p>
