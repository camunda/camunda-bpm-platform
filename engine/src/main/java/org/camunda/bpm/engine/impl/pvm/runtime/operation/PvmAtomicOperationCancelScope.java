/**
 * <p>Base class for implementing an atomic operation which performs <em>cancel scope</em> behavior.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cancel scope behavior is different from "destroy scope" behavior. Destroy scope will delete the
 * scope execution for the current scope. <em>cancel scope</em> will not delete the scope execution itself
 * but will rather</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>find the scope execution for the current scope,</li>
 *   <li>perform an interrupt: this will delete any executions / subprocess instances etc
 *     which are child executions of the scope</li>
 *   <li>set the scope execution to the cancelling activity and move forward.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>So as opposed to <em>destroy scope</em> we will not delete the current scope execution but cancel
 * anything that is happening in the current scope and then, still in the current scope, execute the
 * canceling activity.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage in BPMN:</h2>
 * <p>In the context of BPMN this behavior is required for interrupting constructs like</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>boundary events with cancelActivity="true"</li>
 *   <li>interrupting event subprocesses,</li>
 *   <li>terminate end events etc..</li>
 * </ul>
