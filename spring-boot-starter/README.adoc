#### Migration hints from < 1.3.0 to >= 1.3.0

[IMPORTANT]
We have decided to refactor the configuration mechanism. Especially, we removed the  `org.camunda.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.CamundaConfiguration` interface. For now, each configuration is a `org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.ProcessEnginePlugin`. With this it is possible to hook into `preInit`, `postInit` and `postProcessEngineBuild`, which supports more complex situations.
If you have implemented a `CamundaConfiguration`, you have to switch to `ProcessEnginePlugin` (and its `preInit` method). You can also extend your configuration from `org.camunda.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.impl.AbstractCamundaConfiguration` to avoid a cast to `SpringProcessEngineConfiguration`.

### 1.2.1

* https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter/milestone/5?closed=1[Release Notes 1.2.1]
* https://blog.camunda.org/post/2016/06/camunda-spring-boot-1.2.0-released/[Blog Article for release 1.2.0]
