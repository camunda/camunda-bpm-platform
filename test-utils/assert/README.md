# Camunda Platform Assert

**Camunda Platform Assert** makes it easy to assert the status of your BPMN processes and CMMN cases when driving them forward in your typical unit test methods. Simply write code like

```groovy
assertThat(instance).isWaitingAt("UserTask_InformCustomer");
assertThat(task).hasCandidateGroup("Sales").isNotAssigned();
```

Furthermore a set of static helper methods is provided to make it easier to drive through a process. Based on the [80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) the library reaches out to make those things simple you need really often. You will e.g. often have a single open task instance in your process instance. Then just write
 
```groovy
complete(task(instance), withVariables("approved", true));
```

## Compatibility

Camunda Platform Assert works with the corresponding version of Camunda Platform (i.e., Camunda Platform Assert 7.17.0 is compatible to Camunda Platform 7.17.0). The compatibility between earlier versions are as shown [in the documentation](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/testing/#assertions-version-compatibility).
Camunda Platform Assert is works with multiple Java versions (1.8+). All of this is continuously verified by executing around 500 test cases. 

## Get started

1. Add a maven test dependency to your project:

```xml  
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
    <artifactId>camunda-bpm-assert</artifactId>
    <version>7.17.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Additionally, [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) needs to be provided as a dependency with a version that is compatible with the one documented in the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/testing/#assertions-version-compatibility).

Please note that if you use [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) or the [Camunda Spring Boot Starter](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/) in your project, AssertJ is already included in your project's setup.

2. Add a static import to your test class

Create your test case just as described in the [Camunda Platform Testing Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/testing/) and add Camunda Platform Assert by statically importing it in your test class:

```groovy  
import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.assertions.ProcessEngineTests.*;
```

3. Start using the assertions in your test methods

You now have access to all the Camunda Platform assertions. Assuming you want to assert that your process instance is actually started, waiting at a specific user task and that task should yet be unassigned, but waiting to be assigned to a user of a specific group, just write:

```groovy
assertThat(processInstance).isStarted()
  .task().hasDefinitionKey("edit")
    .hasCandidateGroup("human-resources")
    .isNotAssigned();
```

In case you want to combine Camunda Platform Assert with the assertions provided by AssertJ, your imports should look like this:
```groovy  
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.assertions.ProcessEngineTests.*;
```

Find a more detailed description of the assertions and helper methods available in the Camunda Platform Assert [user guide](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert/blob/master/docs/README.md).

In 2014, the library won the **Camunda Platform Community Award**.

Starting from version 3.0.0 it was adopted as part of the Camunda Platform.
Starting from version 7.17.0 it was merged into the Camunda Platform main repository.
