# How to Contribute

## Writing Docs

All docs are written in Markdown and are located in the `doc/` folder.

### Markdown editing guidelines:

* Use pure Markdown (as opposed to embedded HTML) as much as possible.
* Markdown files should use a linewrap at 100 characters.
* All links must use the id-scheme and references must be placed at the end of the document.
