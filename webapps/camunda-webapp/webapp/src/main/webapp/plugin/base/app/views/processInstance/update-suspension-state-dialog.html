      <p>
        Activating a process instance means that the execution is running, so the <i>token state</i> will change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tasks belonging to this process instance will also be activated.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a process instance is in the state active, the engine will also execute jobs associated with this process instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this process instance have a process instance hierarchy, activating this process instance from the hierarchy will not activate other process instances from that hierarchy.

      <!-- suspension -->
      <p>
        Suspending a process instance means that the execution is stopped, so the <i>token state</i> will not change. However, actions that do not change token state, like setting or removing variables, etc. will still succeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tasks belonging to this process instance will also be suspended. This means that any actions influencing the tasks' lifecycles will fail, such as
        <ul>
          <li>claiming</li>
          <li>completing</li>
          <li>delegation</li>
          <li>changes in task assignees, owners, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        Actions that only change task properties will still succeed, such as changing variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a process instance is in the state suspended, the engine will also not execute jobs associated with this process instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this process instance have a process instance hierarchy, suspending this process instance from the hierarchy will not suspend other process instances from that hierarchy.
